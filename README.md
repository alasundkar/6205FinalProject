# Problem Statement:

Project: Predictive Ranking System of English Premiere League
this.File: RankingSystem.java Factors Considered: Location - Home or
Away Attack Strength - goal scoring ability Defense Strength - goal
conceding weakness

# Driver Class:
This is my main class. It initiates all the pre-requisite functions that are
required to tabulate the final point table. The driver constructor initially
runs and makes assigns the combination id to each of the match that is played
or is supposed to played.
 
This class contains the algorithm design for predicting the ranking of all
the clubs playing in the EPL based on the previous records of the current
season.
 
This class contains two such methods, the details of which are explained in
detail in the project report or the readme file


# MakePairs Class:
this class makes the pairs of team to face a match and each match to be played 
or already played is given a combination ID and is stored in a HashMap
All the pairs are grouped of tw, played or not played
 

Factors Considered: 
Location - Home or Away

Attack Strength - goal scoring ability

Defense Strength - goal conceding weakness


# RankingSystem Class: 
this class is primarily my CSV file reader of sorts. It reads all the
required data values that would be required further in the driver class for
the calculation of the PDF of a match results
